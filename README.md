## NBA Dataset Regression

Resource: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-model/nba_elo.csv

The dataset contains game-by-game Elo ratings and forecasts back to 1946. As a fan of Kobe Bryant, I choose NBA dataset for investigation. For this project, i'm using regression models to predict the score for each team. The models used are: 
      
        1. Linear Regression
        2. Random Forest 
        3. Gradient Boosting  

## Purpose:
   To determine the score of two teams in NBA games. 

## Main steps:
   1. Data Prepartion
   2. Feature correlation
   4. Linear, Random Forest and Gradient boosting regression models are applied

## Result:
For this particular problem, gradient boosting overperfomed the other two regression models.
